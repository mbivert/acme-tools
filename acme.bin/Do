NAME
	$p

SYNOPSYS
	$p [-h]
	$p <cmd> [-a|id|pattern]

DESCRIPTION
	$p runs a command <cmd> in the taglines of the windows pointed by
	[-a|id|pattern], which is forwarded to Getids, thus defaulting to
	\$winid (current window).

	Similar to https://github.com/mkhl/cmd/blob/master/acme/acmeeval/main.go,
	but written in sh(1), orthogonal with Getids's behavior (+Buffer
	management, and X// like looping on filenames patterns.

EXAMPLES
	\$ Do 'Edit ,d' -a
		Clear '+Buffer' window's body
EOF
	exit 0
fi

m=`echo -n "$c" | wc -c`

Getids $2 | while read x; do
	t=`9p read acme/$x/tag | cut -d'|' -f2-`

	# Undocumented in acme(4): don't automatically update
	# menu so that it won't messes our offsets
	Write ctl nomenu $x

	# Empty tag
	Write ctl cleartag $x

	# Compute offset
	n=`9p read acme/$x/tag | wc -c`

	# Write command to tag
	Write tag "$c" $x

	# Execute command
	o=`expr $n + $m`
	echo Mx$n $o | 9p write acme/$x/event

	# Reset tag
	Write ctl cleartag $x
	Write tag "$t" $x

	# Restore automatic menu management
	Write ctl menu $x
done
