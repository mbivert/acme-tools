NAME
	$p

SYNOPSYS
	$p [-h]

DESCRIPTION
	$p "unregisters" \$HOME/acme.hook by killing all the
	processes in the group of the process referenced in
	\$HOME/acme.hook.pid.

BUGS
	This is crude.

	For now, this is only useful because regular file dumping
	mechanism is broken once someone listens to an event file.

	So we need to unhook (before rehooking) each time we want
	to dump. See XDump.
