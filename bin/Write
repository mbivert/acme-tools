NAME
	$p

SYNOPSYS
	$p [-h]
	$p <file> <data> [-a|id|pattern]

DESCRIPTION
	$p writes data to buffer's special file (ctl/addr/body/data, etc.),
	for all files pointed by [-a|id|pattern], forwarded to Getids,
	thus defaulting to \$winid (current window).

EXAMPLES
	# Deletes all existing windows.
	(sh|tagline)\$ Write ctl delete '.*'

	# Appends "hello" to current window's body
	(sh|tagline)\$ Write body hello

	# Rename the current buffer (<data> is processed by printf(1))
	(sh|tagline)\$ Write ctl "name /path/to/newname\n"
EOF
	exit 0
