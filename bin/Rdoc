NAME
	$p

SYNOPSYS
	$p [-h]
	$p [cmd]

DESCRIPTION
	$p executes help(cmd) within R, via Exec. Conceptually,
	this is a shortcut for (there's some extra-boilerplate):
		$ Exec "echo 'help(\$cmd)' | Rscript /dev/stdin"

BUG
	Relies on a sed(1) with the [:print:] character class for
	cleanup.

EOF
	exit 0
fi

# Used to be R -q --no-save < /dev/stdin instead of Rscript
exec Exec "echo 'help($@)' | Rscript /dev/stdin | sed $'s/[^[:print:]\t]//g'"
