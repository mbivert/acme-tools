NAME

SYNOPSYS
	$p [-h]
	$p [-m] [-n] [-p] [-u] [-x] [-g] [-q] <name> [pattern]
	$p [-r]                               [name]

DESCRIPTION
	Open given file with acme, creating it as an empty file
	if necessary.

	If -m is specified, move back to / and open the first file
	that match given name. Note that this mimick Run's -m behavior,
	hence the option's name.

	If -n is specified, nor the file nor its parent directory will
	be created on disk/loaded from disk.

	If -p is specified, print opened files' acme windows' IDs,
	one per line.

	If -u is specified, $p will only open the file if no buffer
	matches the given pattern (unique). If no pattern is specified,
	the name will be used as a pattern instead. If there's already
	a corresponding buffer opened, then some of it will be
	made visible by writing show its acme/$id/ctl.

	-x automatically triggers a chmod +x on the file.

	With -g, the name is interpreted as a pattern
	to be grep(1)'d in \$HOME/acme.files: the first existing
	file matching the pattern is opened. If no match, exit
	with failure. -g implies -u.

	By default, Open will focus on the buffer being opened
	(see acme(4), 'ctl' file, 'show' option): -q disables this
	behavior.

	-r registers a filename to \$HOME/acme.files. If no name is
	specified, then Open tries to collect one from a current
	acme buffer, if any.

	Paths starting with '/' are considered absolutely, otherwise,
	relatively.

	Nonexistent paths are created (mkdir(1) -p).

	Opened filenames are systematically added to \$HOME/acme.files,
	which is cleaned via sort(1) -u, and only contains absolute
	paths.

EXAMPLES
	The following will create a '+Buffer' window if there's no
	window with filename suffixed by +Buffer; this will be
	considered a "virtual" file, not tied to an on-disk file:

		Open -n -u '+Buffer' '\+Buffer$'
