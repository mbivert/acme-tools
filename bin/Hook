NAME
	$p

SYNOPSYS
	$p [-h]

DESCRIPTION
	$p registers a single hook \$HOME/acme.hook to
	all existing buffers, and to all buffers about
	to future buffer.

	win(1) buffers are systematically ignored.

	It also registers a pid in \$HOME/acme.hook.pid for Unhook.

BUGS
	For now at least, the idea is to have a central script
	acting as a hook, that could eventually delegate things
	to other scripts in case there's a need for finer filtering.
